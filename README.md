# Pokémon and Trainers Lab

This project is a Java-based application developed during a series of laboratories focused on Internet Services Architectures. The application revolves around Pokémon and Trainers, where Trainers can have multiple Pokémon (1:N relationship).

## Project Structure

- **Laboratory 1**: Implementation of entity classes (`Pokemon`, `Trainer`), data initialization, and basic operations using Java SE and Stream API.
- **Laboratory 2**: Integration with Spring Framework, Spring Boot, and Spring Data. Enhanced entity classes with JPA annotations, implemented repositories, services, and a command-line runner.
- **Laboratory 3**: Implementation of REST controllers using Spring MVC, DTO classes for CRUD operations, and HTTP request.
- **Laboratory 4**: Decomposition into microservices (Trainer Management and Pokémon Management) with event-based communication and a Spring Cloud Gateway.
- **Laboratory 5**: Angular-based frontend for managing Trainers and Pokémon, with views for listing, adding, editing, and deleting entities.
- **Laboratory 6**: Dockerization of the Spring Boot and Angular applications, with Docker Compose for orchestration.
